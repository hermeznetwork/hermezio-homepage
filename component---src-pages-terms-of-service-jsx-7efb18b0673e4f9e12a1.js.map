We provide website features and services to you when you visit our website located at https://hermez.io and their subdomains (the “website”). Please read these Terms of Service carefully, along with any other policies and notices on the website, (the “Service Terms”) and our Privacy Policy.

Hermez Network provides self-hosted wallet services for Ethereum-based blockchains and these Service Terms outline approved uses of Hermez Network, various licenses that we grant to you, and licenses that you grant us.</p>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMarginLarger}>If you have any questions or comments related to these Terms, please send us a message on our website at hello@hermez.network. If you do not agree to these Service Terms or any modifications to these Services Terms, you should not use Hermez Network.</p>\n        <Title type='h3'>How you accept this policy</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMarginLarger}>By creating or importing a locally hosted wallet (a “Wallet”), or visiting our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms, as well as the accompanying Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change these Service Terms at any time. Any such changes with respect to your use of Hermez Network will take effect immediately when posted on our website. Your continued use of Hermez Network following any such change will signify your acceptance to be bound by the new Service Terms. Please check the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes since you have last reviewed these Service Terms. Failure or delay by Hermez Network in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of these Service Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights.</p>\n        <Title type='h3'>Eligibility</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMarginLarger}>To be eligible to use Hermez Network, you must be at least eighteen (18) years old and be able to form legally binding contracts. If you are using Hermez Network on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that: (a) the legal entity is duly organised and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation; and (b) you are duly authorised by such legal entity to act on its behalf. You can only use Hermez Network if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. By using Hermez Network, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements that we outline in these Service Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use Hermez Network, and we reserve the right to change our eligibility criteria at any time.</p>\n        <Title type='h3'>The blockchain services</Title>\n        <p>Hermez Network is software that:</p>\n        <ul className={classes.list}>\n          <li className={classes.listBullet}>generates private keys that you may use to send and receive Ethereum and related cryptographically secured tokens (the “Virtual Currency”) following Hermez Network protocol;</li>\n          <li className={classes.listBullet}>facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to Ethereum-based blockchains (the “Ethereum Networks”) without requiring you to download or install the associated Ethereum-based software to your local device; and</li>\n          <li className={classes.listBullet}>computational services of generating blocks following Hermez Network protocol.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMargin}>The private key is derived from a message signed by an external Ethereum Wallet and can be used to authorise the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must never send messages signed with your Wallet associated with an address used with Hermez Network to any unauthorised party. You must keep your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet. </p>\n        <Title type='h5'>Hermez Network cannot assist with password retrieval</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMargin}>Hermez Network stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.</p>\n        <Title type='h5'>Virtual Currency transactions</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMargin}>In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the Ethereum Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via the Hermez Network will be confirmed and processed. By using Hermez Network, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Ethereum Networks. </p>\n        <Title type='h5'>Hermez Network does not store or transmit Virtual Currency</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMargin}>We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Ethereum-based blockchains and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that Hermez Network can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency. </p>\n        <Title type='h5'>Accuracy of information provided by user</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMarginLarger}>You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Hermez Network is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Hermez Network. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency.</p>\n        <Title type='h3'>Wallet registration and account information</Title>\n        <Title type='h5'>You must create a Hermez Network Wallet by connecting an existing Ethereum Wallet </Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMargin}>When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key.

Hermez Network has no control over any Ethereum-based blockchain and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Hermez Network account.</p>\n        <Title type='h5'>Taxes</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMarginLarger}>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via Hermez Network, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Ethereum-based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency-related transactions.</p>\n        <Title type='h3'>Third party services and content</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMarginLarger}>In no event shall a description or reference to a third party’s product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement or promotion of such third-party products or services by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any third-party service. You may agree to receive push notifications from third-party content providers. In order to receive push notifications, you must opt into the service. Push notifications will not be automatically enabled on your device for third-party content. We do not control, endorse, or adopt any third-party content shared through push notifications, and will have no responsibility for third-party content including, but not limited to, token availability and/or sales. If, to the extent permitted by Hermez Network, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Hermez Network account, either through the third party’s product or service or through Hermez Network, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your Hermez Network account.</p>\n        <Title type='h3'>Your use of Hermez Network</Title>\n        <p className={classes.paragraphMargin}>As a user of Hermez Network, we grant you a limited, personal, non-commercial, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our services.
