        The decentralized Hermez Protocol, including but not limited to the overall project,
        network, smart contracts, circuits and, in general, software (“Hermez”) is not a Financial, Money-transmitting
        or Payment Service of any kind and in any Jurisdiction. Any Financial or Payment Services terminology used in
        this Whitepaper, on the Website or on any parts of Hermez is intended only as a basic reference, without any
        effective or legal meaning of the same terms in a regulated and/or traditional financial environment. Hermez
        tokens HEZ are strictly utility tokens in any jurisdiction and are not and can not be considered as security or
        otherwise regulated tokens of any kind nor are in any way akin to e-money and/or fiat or asset backed
        stablecoins, whether global or limited in scope. HEZ were and are not offered, sold or placed to the general
        public or to accredited/sophisticated investors and/or entities with an ICO, IEO or any other form of token
        sale, with or without purpose of developing Hermez and the tokens are immediately usable within Hermez. The
        Hermez users, founders, developers and other governance related roles and/or HEZ token holders do not own or
        control Hermez, but simply contribute to its development, maintenance and security in a fully open, community
        driven and decentralized way. This Whitepaper is not a contract or a contractual agreement of any kind, nor a
        prospectus and/or an invitation or offer to invest in Hermez or acquire or use its tokens in any way. Any
        prospective or actual user of Hermez declares to have received appropriate technical, administrative and legal
        advice before and after reading this Whitepaper, the Hermez website and using any part of Hermez (including its
        tokens) and accepts that there is an inherent high risk in acquiring in any way or using any kind of blockchain
        and/or crypto token, platform, software, interface and fully discharge from any non-criminal liability any of
        the persons or entities mentioned here above or within this Whitepaper or on the Hermez Website for any kind of
        damage suffered, including total loss. The HEZ Token is explicitly not intended to be offered, sold, given
        and/or used in any way, directly or indirectly, to and by Citizens or Residents of the U.S.A.
