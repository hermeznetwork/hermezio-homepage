        DISCLAIMER AND NOTES: The decentralized Hermez Protocol, including but not limited to the overall project, smart
        contracts and software (“Hermez”) is not a Financial or Payment Service of any kind and in any Jurisdiction. Any
        Financial or Payment Services terminology used in this Whitepaper, on the Website or on any parts of Hermez is
        intended only as a basic reference, without any effective or legal meaning of the same terms in a regulated
        and/or traditional financial environment. Hermez tokens HEZ and HGT are strictly utility tokens in any
        jurisdiction and are not and can not be considered as security or otherwise regulated tokens of any kind and are
        not in any way e-money and/or fiat or asset backed stablecoins, whether global or limited in scope. HEZ and HGT

        are immediately usable within Hermez. Hermez does not provide any exchange-like, money-transmitting or custodial
        service of any kind for any of the users’ crypto tokens, and transfers are only processed and can only happen
        within the Hermez network itself, which is just a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The HermezDAO and its
        members do not own or control Hermez, but simply contribute to its development, maintenance and security in a
        fully open, community driven and decentralized way. The completely separate, segregated and independent service
        company HermezDao Ltd including any of its current or former subsidiaries and affiliated entities whether active
        or inactive, and each officer, director, employee, partner (general and limited), equity holder, beneficial
        owner direct or indirect, member, manager, agent, subsidiary, affiliate, successor and assign and insurer of any
        of the foregoing does not own nor it exerts any direct or indirect control over Hermez or HermezDAO, and is only
        occasionally engaged as necessary as a third-party service provider. This Whitepaper is not a contract or a
        contractual agreement of any kind, is not an invitation or offer to invest in Hermez or acquire or use its
        tokens in any way. Any user of Hermez declares to have received appropriate technical, administrative and legal
        advice before and after reading this Whitepaper, the Hermez website and using any part of Hermez (including its
        tokens) and accepts that there is an inherent high risk in acquiring or using any kind of blockchain and/or
        crypto token, platform, software, interface and acknowledges with full disclaimer any of the persons or entities
